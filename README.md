# CS4341-Artificial-Intelligence

These are the two projects given to us in the CS 4341 course at WPI.

The objective of the first project is to create an AI for the game Connect-N, which is a generalized version of Connect-4.

The objective of the second project is to develop an AI that is capable of playing the game Bomberman in 10 different situations, and have the AI surivive at least 80% of the time.
